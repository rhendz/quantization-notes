    "In symmetric quantization, we map the floating-point range to the quantized range with respect to $0$ - think along the lines of $[-100,100]$. To do so, we choose $\\alpha = \\max|x_f| = -\\max(x_f)$ and $\\max(x_f)$, where $x_f$ is some number in the floating-point range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we choose $N_{bins} = 2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits we want to quantize to. In order to derive our quantization range with respect to $0$, we simply place half the bins before $0$ and the other half after $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say we wanted an 8-bit quantization range. Then, the number of bins would be $N_{bins} = 2^8 = 256 \\implies [0,255] \\implies [-128,127]$. That is the \"full range\" symmetric around 0. However in practice, this range is generally \"restricted\" to $[-127,127]$.
